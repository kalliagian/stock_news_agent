            "“Demand is at the heart of the problem,” analysts led by Adam Jonas said in a note. “Tesla has grown too big relative to near-term demand, putting great strain on the fundamentals.”\n",
            "Jonas lowered his “bear case” for Tesla shares from a previous estimate of $97, which assumes Tesla misses its current sales forecast in China by about half, and kept a price target of $230. The stock fell 2.6% to $200 a share in pre-market trading.\n",
            "Tesla has drawn criticism for weak deliveries. Tesla handed over just 63,000 cars in the first quarter, yet expects to deliver as many as 100,000 cars in the second and four times that for the year. Hitting the full-year target is going to be a “Herculean task,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday.\n",
            "Trade Drag\n",
            "To boost demand, Tesla will have to aggressively expand into China, offer lower-priced sport utility vehicles and supply mobility fleets, according to Morgan Stanley’s Jonas. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China and new competitors put this strategy at risk, he added.\n",
            "“We give Tesla credit for tapping into the world’s largest EV market for a number of years” in China, Jonas said. “We strongly suspect a host of national champions to emerge.”\n",
            "Tesla has declined 38% since the start of the year and on Monday breached the $200 a share level, before closing 2.7% lower at $205.36. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk last week called for a “hardcore” review of all the company’s expenses amid warnings of potentially severe fallout from a fatal crash involving the Autopilot driver assistance system.\n",
            "Musk also raised concerns over the company’s cash burn, referring to Tesla losing $700 million in the first quarter. The carmaker raised about $2.4 billion in capital recently, but Musk said this won’t last long.\n",
            "Tesla isn’t alone in battling weaker global markets, including China. Germany’s central bank warned the nation’s auto industry -- one of the key pillars of Europe’s largest economy -- is facing more trouble as China’s slowdown deepens. The slump, combined with U.S.-China trade tensions, comes just as incumbent carmakers are spending heavily to develop electric cars.\n",

            "The Cupertino, California-based technology giant employs people that listen to less than 1% of Siri commands in order to improve the voice-based digital assistant. Concerns over technology companies listening to and analyzing what is spoken to voice assistants started to be raised after Bloomberg News first reported that Amazon.com Inc. and Apple had teams analyzing recordings earlier this year. Last week, the Guardian reported that Apple contractors said that they often hear sex, drug deals and confidential medical information.\n",
            "“We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy,” Apple said in a statement. “While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.”\n",
            "The company’s move comes the same week that a German regulator temporarily stopped Google employees and contractors from transcribing home assistant voice recordings in the European Union after whistleblowers said some recordings contained sensitive information. A Hamburg agency said Aug. 1 that Google agreed to a three-month stoppage while it investigates whether the practice complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.\n",
            "Bloomberg News reported in April that Amazon employs thousands of people around the world who listen to voice recordings captured by its line of Echo speakers in owners’ homes and offices, with the goal of improving its Alexa digital assistant. The recordings are transcribed, annotated and then fed back into the software as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa’s understanding of human speech and help it better respond to commands.\n",
            "Apple’s Siri also has human helpers, who work to gauge whether the digital assistant’s interpretation of requests lines up with what the person said. The recordings they review lack personally identifiable information and are stored for six months tied to a random identifier, according to an Apple security white paper. The company doesn’t disclose directly in iOS that it uses a portion of recordings for its “grading” process, but it is mentioned in the white paper.\n",

            "George Mack, a newsletter writer and marketing executive, said having two phones helped him fix his phone addiction.\n",
            "He said one phone inspires serotonin, while the phone with social media apps is all dopamine.\n",
            "Many Americans who spend too much time on their smartphone romanticize about getting rid of it altogether and returning to the days of flip phones and T9 predictive text. Some actually do it.\n",
            "But what if the solution is not fewer phones, but more? That's exactly what George Mack, a newsletter writer, marketing exec, and Twitter personality, said helped him solve his smartphone addiction.\n",
            "Mack said he now has two phones: a \"cocaine phone\" and a \"kale phone.\"\n",
            "He described his kale phone as \"full stack serotonin\" — the brain chemical associated with happiness, focus, and calmness, according to Cleveland Clinic. Mack said the only apps on this phone are notes, Kindle, Uber, and Maps, and that only two to three people have the number, in case of emergencies.\n",
            "His cocaine phone, on the other hand, is \"full stack dopamine\" — the brain chemical associated with motivation and rewards. Social media is known to trigger the brain's reward system by releasing dopamine with each swipe, ultimately turning us all into dopamine junkies who are always craving just a bit more. Mack's cocaine phone has the time-killing apps you'd expect: Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp, and allows anyone to call.\n",
            "He goes into detail on Twitter about how he uses each phone, but ultimately what kinds of phones you use and what you put on them will depend on your specific circumstances and needs. He said he's gotten \"countless DM's of people who have said this has fixed their smartphone addiction.\"\n",
            "Mack's not the first person to suggest a two-phone solution, but thinking about it in terms of kale and cocaine, or serotonin and dopamine, could be useful in figuring out how to divvy up your phone usage. The two phones could also help set boundaries about when you're using your phone as a useful tool, and when you're using it in ways that aren't a net positive on your life.\n",

            "\"I think there's going to be an opportunity for us to pick up theaters quite inexpensively and pick up really high-quality theaters and potentially quite profitable theaters,\" Aron said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). \"Right now, because of the unique position we’re in, that we have liquidity and a lot of our competitors do not, I think we're going to be able to actually pick up more very fine locations and do it at bargain basement prices.\"\n",
            "Movie theaters tried a range of strategies to reengage customers after pandemic shutdowns and a surge in direct-to-consumer entertainment that prompted some studios to release box office titles directly on streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX), HBO Max (WBD), and Disney+ (DIS).\n",
            "But a weak box office lineup in the third quarter didn’t make that comeback story any easier for the industry, despite the best efforts of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in \"Black Adam.\"\n",
            "\"There are a number of smaller movie circuits that are in real trouble because they didn't raise the kind of money that we raised during the pandemic,\" Aron said. \"And they're running on fumes.\"\n",
            "In September, Cineworld — the parent company of Cinemark, Regal, and Picturehouse theaters — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and commenced a \"real estate optimization strategy.\" The process was initiated after lighter-than-expected traffic to its theaters slowed recovery efforts amid the pandemic.\n",
            "Meanwhile, AMC capitalized on the visibility it received after a short squeeze briefly catapulted the stock in January 2021. The movie theater chain executed strategically timed equity offerings to raise additional cash.\n",
            "\"AMC raised a lot of money in 2020 and 2021,\" Aron said. \"We raised $2.25 billion by selling stock into the marketplace. And so when you look at our cash reserves, at the end of the third quarter, we had $900 million in liquidity.\"\n",
            "Nevertheless, the CEO's willingness to spend on theater locations is counterbalanced by AMC's own closures of underperforming venues. Since the pandemic began, AMC has reduced its footprint by 57 locations overall, closing 106 locations and opening 49 new venues.\n",
            "That hasn't deterred Aron, who sees a connection point for moviegoers returning to the theater experience as well as a larger addressable market through new investments, which include a mining company, AMC-branded credit cards, and a recent partnership with Zoom (ZM).\n",
            "\"We think that's going to be a real boost for our meetings business,\" Aron said on the company's Zoom Rooms partnership, adding: \"that's the next one to come after our investment last winter in Hycroft, the gold and silver mine out in Nevada.\"\n",

            "To Musk’s credit, Tesla did make substantial progress in mass-manufacturing electric vehicles last year, after overcoming the “production hell” he predicted the company would go through starting in the fall of 2017. Total deliveries more than tripled last year.\n",
            "Still, making 500,000 vehicles in 2019 will be difficult based on the guidance Musk and CFO Deepak Ahuja gave late last month: that Tesla may need until the end of this year to reach a weekly production rate of 7,000 Model 3s.\n",
            "If the company were to average that pace for the full year, without taking any time off at its plant in Fremont, California, it would assemble about 365,000 of those cars. Tesla produced another roughly 101,500 Model S sedans and Model X crossovers last year, and has dialed back output of those models in early 2019. Musk and Ahuja, who is retiring, said the expiration of the full federal tax credit in the U.S. at the end of December probably pulled ahead some demand and cautioned deliveries will be lower in the first quarter.\n",
            "To expand its business in China, Tesla is building a plant in Shanghai and is looking to start production there late this year.\n",
            "The electric-vehicle maker kicked off this year on a dull note, with fourth-quarter deliveries slightly lagging expectations.

            "Right now, one of the biggest issues that expectant and new mothers face is that care from their gynecologist ends as soon as they leave the hospital after giving birth. And to be fair, much of the care they need in the postpartum period should be delivered by other types of specialists, like pelvic floor therapists, postpartum mental healthcare providers, acupuncturists and others.\n",
            "Unfortunately, however, most of these specialists aren't covered by insurance providers. And the ones who are are in short supply, while others can cost quite a bit. The reason for this is that many of these specialists run their own small practice, and the administrative burden of working alongside insurance providers is high, for less reimbursement.\n",

            "Tackling the problem here in the States was not a matter of building a great product, though the administrative functionality of Zaya's platform is mission-critical. Rather, it was about solving for distribution, both on the provider and the patient side.\n",

The platform currently has 50 providers visible and available to patients, with over 500 on the waiting list to get vetted and join Zaya.\n",
            "I asked Runge if the company was looking at CityBlock as a leader when trying to rearrange the healthcare system while working within its existing boundaries. She explained that Toyin Ajayi, Cityblock cofounder and president, was actually an investor in the round and has been instrumental in workshopping the platform and product.\n",

            "Article: summarize: The U.S. Department of Energy is reviving an old loan program and its first recipient is the joint battery venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution. The $2.5 billion loan issued to GM and LG Energy will be used to help finance the construction of new lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities.\n",
            "Reuters was first to report the news.\n",
            "The loan to Ultium Cells, the name of the GM-LG joint venture, is expected to close in the coming months and will be used for its upcoming facilities in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan. GM and LG have plans to invest more than $7 billion to jointly build three battery plants. Production at the Ohio factory is expected to begin in August. In Tennessee, production is scheduled for late 2023, and in Michigan for 2024.\n",
            "Ultium told Reuters the facilities will create 5,000 new high-tech jobs in the U.S. The loan agreement requires Ultium to offer employees local prevailing wage and fringe benefits.\n",
            "The funds come from the government's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program, which was tasked with issuing up to $17.7 billion in federal loans and hasn't funded a new loan since 2010.\n",
            "Tesla was one of the last automakers to receive a loan back in 2009, when the DOE loaned the EV-maker $465 million to help build its Model S sedan. To date, the program has dolled out $8 billion for products that have supported the production of more than 4 million advanced technology vehicles, according to the DOE. Ford and Nissan also received $5.9 billion in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2010, respectively.\n",
            "While the plan is the first time the DOE will issue a loan exclusively for a battery cell manufacturing project under the vehicle program, it's not the first time we're seeing governments get involved in securing battery supply.\n",
            "Joint ventures between automakers and battery chemistry and cell manufacturers have been cropping up regionally in recent years in response to a de-globalizing post-COVID world. Governments in Germany, South Korea and China have already begun financially backing local battery manufacturing to help shore up supply chains.\n",
            "The resurrected DOE loan program suggests the Biden Administration is also keen to secure its supply chain as part of its plan for half of all new passenger vehicles sales to be EVs by 2030.\n",
            "The DOE did not respond in time to TechCrunch's questions about whether it would continue to fund battery projects. In April, the agency said it had issued a conditional commitment for a $107 million loan to Australian graphite miner Syrah Resources to expand en EV battery parts plant in Louisiana. Graphite is a crucial piece of the anode of lithium ion batteries.\n",
            "The agency said in February it plans to provide $3.1 billion in funding from Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make more batteries and components in America, boost domestic supply chains and create jobs.\n",

            "Article: summarize: (Bloomberg) -- The titans of private equity, who have long grumbled that shareholders don’t show them enough love, are rolling out a sweetener: distributable earnings.\n",
            "Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle Group LP recently adopted it as their key metric after KKR & Co. changed last year. The yardstick, which strips out mark-to-market valuations, promises to make quarterly results less volatile, particularly in turbulent markets.\n",
            "The share prices of these giant firms have mostly lagged the broader market since they went public, which for Blackstone was more than a decade ago. The new barometer, which includes cash income from asset sales and management fees, is the latest effort to win over shareholders. It shines a light on the huge stockpile of assets -- Blackstone alone raised $100 billion in 2018 -- that they have gathered.\n",
            "“A lot of actions these firms take are to increase shareholder value,” said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities. “They are looking for things they can do to improve the narrative and improve the investor base.”\n",
            "Reducing Volatility\n",
            "The volatility inherent in the formula the firms had been using -- economic net income -- was laid bare once again in the fourth quarter. The measure, which captures both realized and unrealized gains, requires private assets to be marked to market.\n",
            "Apollo Global Management LLC, which still relies on economic net income, took a beating largely because the S&P 500 Index had its worst quarter in seven years. Apollo posted its biggest quarterly loss in eight years as its private equity portfolio plummeted.\n",
            "Apollo’s rivals mostly sidestepped that tsunami. With their new math, KKR and Carlyle saw their distributable earnings rise. Blackstone also posted a profit but a smaller one than a year earlier. These firms say the metric better reflects how they run their businesses.\n",
            "“I am a supporter of this metric,” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research Corp. “It’s hard for analysts like myself to predict unrealized losses. We can predict fee-related earnings much better. It’s a stable component of earnings.”\n",
            "C-Corp Results\n",
            "Some private equity firms have also converted to a C-corp -- or are considering it -- to try to get more recognition in the market. The change from a partnership makes it possible for them to be included in indexes and increase their mutual fund ownership.\n",
            "But the benefits of a C-corp conversion remain a question. Since KKR announced in May that it was making the switch, its shares have gained less than Blackstone’s, a partnership. Blackstone, which manages $472.2 billion, has been weighing whether becoming a C-corp makes sense.\n",
            "Likewise, firms can’t count on shareholders to reward them just because they now tally profit differently, with an emphasis on fees from the steady collection of assets.\n",
            "“Let’s see if this helps,” Ryan said.\n",

            "Sterling has gained more than 3 percent versus the dollar this year, the most among its Group-of-10 peers, on conviction that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has receded. Fund managers at both Aberdeen Standard Investments and BlueBay Asset Management LLP think that the risks are tilted to the downside for the U.K. currency against the greenback.\n",
            "“In the short term, I see value in selling the pound versus the dollar as it’s moved a long way in a short period of time and I think the market has got carried away with the falling probability of no deal,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. “I don’t agree that Parliament is easily able to prevent no deal.”\n",
            "The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.3155 Monday as profit-taking took over from buying interest from real-money accounts. It weakened for the first time in six days versus the euro, slipping 0.3 percent to 86.72 pence.\n",
            "One of the amendments to Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal gaining traction among members of Parliament aims to delay Brexit beyond the March 29 deadline and avoid a chaotic no-deal. The chances of getting the amendments through the House of Commons depend on how May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn instruct their MPs to vote.\n",
            "Downside Risks\n",
            "If none of the amendments pass, May will be left once again with a deal that lacks enough support and no viable alternative option. The current impasse is likely to drag on, meaning risks for the pound are tilted to the downside, according to Mark Dowding, a money manager at BlueBay Asset Management LLP.\n",
            "He sees Brexit ultimately being overturned following a second referendum, but before then sees the pound weakening as the March deadline approaches. “I’m doubtful much happens until March,” said Dowding. “There may be a majority for no hard Brexit, but unless something else is actually agreed, this is the de facto position come March 29.”\n",
            "Still, for some analysts, the political turmoil is no more than a temporary blip on the pound’s broader uptrend for 2019. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees sterling being the best-performing currency in the G-10 this year, while Morgan Stanley says the pound is very cheap.\n",
            "The pound rose above $1.32 Friday for the first time since October. The U.K. currency will climb to $1.36 by year-end, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey and even Aberdeen’s Athey is betting on gains in the long term.\n",
            "He points to political turmoil in Europe and the pound’s historically cheap level as a reason to buy. Athey said that he remains short the euro against sterling and has made little adjustment to size of the position since 2016.\n",
            "“While there is always a risk of disappointment and some correction after the sharp pound appreciation of the past couple of weeks, we think this would likely be temporary,” said Kathrin Goretzki, a strategist at UniCredit SpA. “We see room for further sterling appreciation in the coming weeks.”\n",
